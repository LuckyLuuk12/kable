- Follow Rust best practices and idioms.
- Ensure code is well-documented (inline)
- Do not provide .md files with documentation
- Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
- Do not include tests unless explicitly requested.
- Scan/look for files/whole codebase if not enough context is available.
- Only respond in clear lists, no paragraphs are needed, be concise and direct.
- Never make "documentation readme" files
- Avoid running `npm run dev`, this is only useful for human evaluation.
- NEVER replace existing code with "// ...existing code" or similar comments, if you edit code be sure to only edit the relevant parts and just keep the existing code...
