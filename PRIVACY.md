## Authentication and Microsoft Integration

### How Authentication Works
Kable uses Microsoft's official authentication system for Minecraft accounts:

1. **You initiate login** through the Kable interface
2. **Microsoft login page opens** in your default browser
3. **You authenticate directly with Microsoft** - we never see your credentials
4. **Microsoft provides authentication tokens** to Kable
5. **Tokens are stored securely** on your local device only

### What We Access
Through Microsoft's authentication system, we only receive:
- **Access tokens** for Minecraft services (stored locally)
- **Username and UUID** for your Minecraft account (stored locally)
- **Account status** (active, expired, etc.)

### What We Don't Access
- ‚ùå **Your Microsoft account password**
- ‚ùå **Personal information from your Microsoft account**
- ‚ùå **Email addresses or contact information**
- ‚ùå **Other Microsoft services data**
- ‚ùå **Payment information**

## Third-Party Services

### No Data Sharing
- We do not share any information with these services beyond what's necessary for functionality

## Local Application Logs

### What's Logged Locally

- **Access**: Only you have access to these files

### Managing Logs
