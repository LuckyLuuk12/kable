# Kable
### An Unofficial Minecraft Launcher

Kable is a modern, developer-friendly Minecraft launcher built with Tauri and Svelte. Designed for power users and modders, it provides extensive customization options, transparent operation, and advanced debugging tools. Unlike traditional launchers, Kable emphasizes **modifiability** and **transparency** - offering comprehensive logging, detailed configuration options, and open-source architecture that lets you understand and modify every aspect of your Minecraft experience.

## üéÆ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher installed on your system
- A valid Minecraft account (Java Edition)
- Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or a modern Linux distribution

### Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Install the application for your platform:
   - **Windows**: Run the `.msi` installer
   - **macOS**: Open the `.dmg` file and drag Kable to Applications
   - **Linux**: Install the `.deb` package or extract the `.tar.gz` archive

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus & Security Notice

**Windows Users**: You may encounter antivirus warnings when downloading or running Kable. This is common for new, unsigned applications and does **not** indicate malware.

**Why this happens:**
- Kable is currently unsigned (code signing certificates cost hundreds of dollars annually)
- New applications haven't built reputation with antivirus vendors yet
- Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" warnings

**What you can do:**
1. **Windows Defender/SmartScreen**: Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"
2. **Other Antivirus**: Add Kable to your antivirus whitelist/exclusions
3. **Verify Download**: Check that you downloaded from the official [GitHub Releases](../../releases) page
4. **Source Code**: Review the open-source code for transparency

**Our commitment to security:**
- ‚úÖ All code is open source and publicly auditable
- ‚úÖ Builds are automated through GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ No telemetry or data collection (by us)
- ‚úÖ Network requests only for legitimate purposes: Minecraft authentication, mod browsing (Modrinth), version manifests, and mod downloads
- ‚úÖ Builds are reproducible and verifiable

As Kable gains popularity and reputation, these warnings will naturally decrease. We're working on alternative solutions like Microsoft Store distribution to improve trust.

### First Launch
1. Open Kable
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Set your Minecraft installation directory (if different from default)
4. Browse or create installations
5. Launch and enjoy!
