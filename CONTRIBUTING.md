## ÔøΩ AI-Assisted Development

### Our Stance on AI
We **welcome and encourage** the use of AI tools for development! AI can be incredibly helpful for:
- **Code generation** and boilerplate creation
- **Bug fixing** and problem-solving
- **Documentation** writing and improvement
- **Test creation** and edge case discovery
- **Code review** and optimization suggestions

### Requirements for AI-Generated Code
However, we have **strict requirements** for AI-assisted contributions:

#### ‚úÖ You MUST:
- **Read and understand** every line of AI-generated code before submitting
- **Test thoroughly** - AI code often needs adjustments to work correctly
- **Verify correctness** - Ensure the code actually solves the intended problem
- **Check for security issues** - AI can introduce vulnerabilities
- **Ensure code quality** - Make sure it follows our style guidelines
- **Add proper comments** - Explain complex logic, especially if AI-generated
- **Take responsibility** - You are accountable for all code in your PR, regardless of how it was created

#### ‚ùå You MUST NOT:
- **Copy-paste blindly** without understanding what the code does
- **Submit untested code** - "it compiles" is not enough
- **Ignore code style** - AI often doesn't follow project conventions
- **Skip code review** - Always review AI suggestions critically
- **Submit broken code** - Test everything before creating a PR

### Best Practices for AI Usage

#### Code Generation
```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Blindly copied from AI
const result = await someComplexFunction(data);

// ‚úÖ GOOD: AI-generated but reviewed and understood
const result = await someComplexFunction(data);
// This function processes the installation data and returns a validated config
// We need to handle the potential errors from invalid mod loader types
```

#### Testing AI Code
- **Run the code** in your local environment
- **Test edge cases** that AI might have missed
- **Verify error handling** works as expected
- **Check performance** for large datasets
- **Validate security** implications

#### Documentation
- **Explain complex AI-generated logic** in comments
- **Document any AI-specific patterns** or optimizations used
- **Note if code behavior** differs from typical patterns

### Why These Requirements?

#### Code Quality
- **AI isn't perfect** - it can generate buggy, inefficient, or insecure code
- **Context matters** - AI might not understand the full project context
- **Consistency** - AI often doesn't follow project-specific patterns
- **Maintainability** - Code you don't understand is hard to maintain

#### Review Efficiency
- **Faster PR reviews** when code is well-understood by the author
- **Better discussions** when contributors can explain their implementation choices
- **Reduced back-and-forth** on obviously broken or inappropriate code
- **Focus on architecture** rather than basic correctness issues

#### Learning and Growth
- **Skill development** - Understanding code makes you a better developer
- **Project knowledge** - Helps you contribute more effectively over time
- **Problem-solving** - Learn from AI suggestions rather than just copying them

### AI Tools We Recommend
- **GitHub Copilot** - Great for in-editor suggestions
- **ChatGPT/Claude** - Excellent for explaining complex problems
- **Cursor/Windsurf** - AI-powered IDEs with good context awareness
- **Codeium** - Free alternative to Copilot
- **Tabnine** - Privacy-focused AI completion

### Declaring AI Usage
While not required, we appreciate when contributors mention AI usage in PRs:
```markdown
## AI Usage
This PR used AI assistance for:
- Initial implementation of the mod loader detection algorithm
- Test case generation for edge cases
- Documentation improvements

All code has been reviewed, tested, and understood before submission.
```

### The Bottom Line
**AI is a powerful tool, but you are the developer.** Use AI to enhance your productivity, but always take responsibility for the final result. We'd rather receive well-understood, AI-assisted code than poorly understood "pure" human code.

Remember: **The goal is shipping quality software, not proving human superiority over AI.**

## üé® Code Style

### General Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Write readable, maintainable code
- **Consistency** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- **Documentation** - Comment complex logic and public APIs
- **Performance** - Consider performance implications of changes

### TypeScript/JavaScript
```typescript
// Use clear, descriptive variable names
const minecraftInstallations = await getInstallations();

// Prefer async/await over promises
async function loadUserProfile(): Promise<UserProfile> {
    try {
        const profile = await fetchProfile();
        return profile;
    } catch (error) {
        Logger.error('Failed to load profile:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Use proper typing
interface InstallationConfig {
    name: string;
    version: string;
    modLoader: ModLoaderType;
    memory?: number;
}
```

### Rust
```rust
// Use descriptive function names
pub async fn load_minecraft_installations() -> Result<Vec<Installation>, AppError> {
    // Implementation
}

// Proper error handling
fn parse_version_manifest(content: &str) -> Result<VersionManifest, AppError> {
    serde_json::from_str(content)
        .map_err(|e| AppError::Json(format!("Failed to parse manifest: {}", e)))
}

// Use appropriate logging levels
Logger::info_global("Loading installations...", None);
Logger::debug_global(&format!("Found {} versions", versions.len()), None);
```

### Svelte Components
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    // Use TypeScript for component props
    interface Props {
        installation: Installation;
        onLaunch?: (id: string) => void;
    }
    
    let { installation, onLaunch }: Props = $props();
    
    // Use descriptive event handlers
    function handleLaunchClick() {
        onLaunch?.(installation.id);
    }
</script>

<!-- Use semantic HTML and proper accessibility -->
<button 
    class="launch-button"
    onclick={handleLaunchClick}
    aria-label="Launch {installation.name}"
>
    Launch
</button>

<style>
    .launch-button {
        /* Use CSS custom properties for theming */
        background: var(--primary-color);
        color: var(--primary-text);
    }
</style>
```

### Commit Message Format

```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
