# Default Soundpack

The default soundpack uses built-in placeholder sounds.

For the full implementation, you'll need to add actual audio files here:

- `click.mp3` - Button click sound
- `hover.mp3` - Button hover sound
- `success.mp3` - Success notification
- `error.mp3` - Error notification
- `notification.mp3` - General notification
- `launch.mp3` - Game launch sound

You can find free sound effects from:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- https://soundbible.com/

Or create your own using audio editing software.

## License

Make sure any sounds you add are properly licensed for distribution.
